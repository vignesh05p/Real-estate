# Real Estate Price Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict real estate prices using machine learning techniques. The prediction model is built upon a dataset containing various features such as location, size, number of rooms, etc. By training the model on historical data, it can learn patterns and correlations between these features and the corresponding prices, allowing it to make accurate predictions for new properties.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about real estate properties, including features such as:
- Location (latitude, longitude, address)
- Size (area in square feet/meters)
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Type of property (apartment, house, condo, etc.)
- Age of the property
- Amenities (e.g., parking, pool, gym)
- Nearby facilities (schools, hospitals, supermarkets)

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Additional features may be derived from the existing ones, or feature selection techniques may be applied to identify the most relevant features.
3. **Model Selection**: Various machine learning algorithms are considered for the task, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting methods. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques are employed to optimize model performance.
4. **Evaluation**: The models are evaluated using appropriate metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared score to assess their predictive accuracy.
5. **Deployment**: Once a satisfactory model is trained, it can be deployed as a web application or API for real-time predictions.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-estate-price-prediction.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks to explore the data, preprocess it, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.
